Patches made against openbox git master.

Tested and working on Gentoo with openbox 3.6.1-r8.

keep-border-on-maximize.patch
like it says on the tin.

remove-borders-on-maximize.patch
removes top and bottom borders during vertical maximize, like openbox does for horizontal maximize by default. Also changes the titlebar height to compensate for lack of borders during maximize.
